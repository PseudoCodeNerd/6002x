"""
Letâ€™s analyze the complexity of mergeSort . We already know that the time
complexity of merge is O(len(L)) . At each level of recursion the total number of
elements to be merged is len(L) . Therefore, the time complexity of mergeSort is
O(len( L )) multiplied by the number of levels of recursion. Since mergeSort divides
the list in half each time, we know that the number of levels of recursion is
O(log(len( L )) . Therefore, the time complexity of mergeSort is O(n * log(n)) , where n
is len(L) .
